In this repository, I'm trying a few ideas for creating an easy to use and safe enviroment for using I2P, after previous projects to do so sadly never followed through.

I will look at projects like the Tor Browser Bundle for inspiration on how to do this.

Currently both Firefox, as well as Chromium are being experimented on to find what is better suited for this kind of project.

uMatrix, an extension available for either browser will be used rather then NoScript, as it doesn't just block scripts from being executed, but rather from being accessed in the first place.
